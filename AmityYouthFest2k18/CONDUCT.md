#### The code of conduct that follow apply to all.
1. No harassment, including personal attacks. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
2. No spam. This includes doing attention-catching things like writing in all caps, using linkbait headlines. Posts not relating to hackathons or tech will also be considered spam. Don't oversell your product or yourself to the point that people are getting bugged.
3. No illegal/pirated content, requests for it, or information regarding the distribution of it.
4. No telling people they or their post is not welcome. If you think a post does not belong, report the post or message an admin. Don't make people feel unwelcome.
5. You must NOT give intentionally misleading advice.
6. Make sure you do not harm the property of Amity University, Noida or the Amity Incubator, incase of any incident, report to volunteers.
7. We encourage everyone to participate and are committed to building a community for all. Although we will fail at times, we seek to treat everyone both as fairly and equally as possible. Whenever a participant has made a mistake, we expect them to take responsibility for it.

## Incident Reporting
If you have an issue with a member or moderator please take it up with the moderators privately. We promise that everything will be confidential and we wonâ€™t get mad at you if you have a complaint against a moderator.
We also have a confidential 
[form](http://bit.ly/hackthenightreportincident) if you would rather your incident not be tied to your identity.

## Why is this moderator ignoring my messages?
Moderators are volunteers, busy bees. They will usually reply to you very promptly or connect you with someone who can, but if your query is taking time, please be patient.

## What if I disagree with the moderator who reached out to me?
Feel free to reach out to other moderators or fill the [form](http://bit.ly/htn-suggestions).
